  The DANish regional atmospheric ReAnalysis (DANRA) is a
  novel high-resolution (2.5 km) reanalysis dataset covering
  Denmark and its surrounding regions over a 34-year period
  (1990-2023). Denmark's complex coastline, with over 400
  islands and an extensive 7,400 km coastline, means that
  most municipalities experience mixed land-sea variability.
  This complexity requires a regional climate reanalysis
  that can resolve fine-scale coastal and inland features,
  as well as their impact on climate variability. DANRA is
  based on the HARMONIE-AROME Numerical Weather Prediction
  (NWP) model and assimilates a comprehensive set of
  observations, with a particular focus on Denmark. Compared
  to global reanalyses such as the ECMWF Reanalysis v5
  (ERA5), DANRA demonstrates superior performance in
  representing essential climate variables, including
  near-surface weather parameters during both extreme and
  ordinary conditions. We illustrate these improvements in
  the representation of several extreme weather cases over
  Denmark, such as the December 1999 hurricane-force storm,
  the July 2022 national temperature record, and the August
  2007 cloudburst in South Jutland. DANRA is made to support
  climate adaptation, impact modelling, and the training of
  next-generation data-driven atmospheric forecasting
  models. DANRA is distributed as Zarr dataset freely
  accessible from an object store, maximizing its usability
  for climate adaptation, impact modelling, and data-driven
  research.
