# danra-book

This is a jupyter book for the DANRA (Danish Reanalysis) project and dataset.

## Overview

This Jupyter book serves as an interactive guide and documentation for the DANRA dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with the DANRA book, you can clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
We recommend using PDM to create a virtual environment to manage the dependencies.

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.dmi.dk:nwp/danra/danra-book.git
cd danra-book
pdm install
```

Navigate to the `danra-book/notebooks` directory and start explore and/or create new notebooks.
To add a new notebook, to the jupyter book, you can add the notebook to the `danra-book/notebooks` directory and add the path to the notebook in the `_toc.yml` file.
